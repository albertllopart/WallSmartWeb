## Welcome to WallSmart

WallSmart is an artificial intelligence oriented game where you have to build your own Mall, with limited space and money. Your objective through the game is to sustain that mall at the same time that you manage to keep it safe aswell you return the credit to the bank.

### Gameplay


### NPCs

# Pokémon Go Player
They are little girls that will roam around your mall looking for PokéStops, a special building that you can purchase using your UI. Every time they reach one they will give you money. If they fail to find a PokéStop they will flee home. They will also flee when night comes or if their mobile phone gets stolen, so be careful with thieves around.

# Thief
They will wander around your mall looking for Pokémon Go Players to rob their mobile phones, causing them to flee home while being unable to earn money for the player. If you are having trouble with them, consider hiring some security, using your UI!

# Police Man
They will patrol by following a path that goes all around the mall looking for thieves. If they spot one with their lantern, they will signal the thieve to go away with a whistle. Then that thief will flee out of your mall so the Pokémon Go Players can keep on looking for PokéStops with safety!

# Customer
They will head to the center of your mall only to decide then what are they going to buy! If they can find what they are looking for they will give you some money, but if they can't they will return home empty handed with full pockets.

### Some Rules

This is your own personal mall, but still there are some rules that you cannot control!

- The more PokéStops you build, the faster Pokémon Go Players will spawn.
- Customers have random preferences, so maybe they don't like the shops that you have built. It's up to you do find out what are their likes. Maybe try guessing them by looking at their appearence? Don't need to judge them, though.
- You can only build at night, so think well your next purchase during the day while you observe the chaos that you're creating!
